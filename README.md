# NFC Android App

This was coded as part of a group project for university in which we used NFC as a way of signing in and out of barriers. This app was made to reply to APDU commands with a user id, there was also a fake login screen with predetermined users and the user id sent to the NFC reader was the username entered on the login screen. This wasnt a very secure implementation but it made it a lot easier to demonstrate.
